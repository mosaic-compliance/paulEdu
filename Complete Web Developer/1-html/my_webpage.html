        <h2>A few Facts about the Outback</h2>

        <img src="outback.jpeg">
        <p>The Outback is the vast, remote interior of Australia.  While often envisaged as being arid, the Outback regions extend from the northern to southern Australian coastlines, and encompass a number of climatic zones. Culturally, the Outback is deeply ingrained in Australian heritage, history and folklore.</p>

        <h3>About the Outback</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Aborignals: </strong>Indigenous Australians have lived in the Outback for approximately 50,000 years.</li>
            

            <li><strong>Wildlife: </strong>The Australian Outback is full of very important well-adapted wildlife, although much of it may not be immediately visible to the casual observer. Many animals, such as red kangaroos and dingoes, hide in the bushes to rest and keep cool during the heat of the day.</li>
                 
            
            <li><strong>Economics: </strong> Other than agriculture and tourism, the main economic activity in this vast and sparsely settled area is mining. </li>
